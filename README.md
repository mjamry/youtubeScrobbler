====================

This is a music player application.
Main aim was to give you a way of listening music without need to install anything on your computer and scrobbling it on Last.fm portal.

For now it supports music only from youtube. But in future it will be extended to handle other well known music portals, and also a local music files (e.g. mp3).

It is minimalistic - it was one of requirements - easy to use, and there is no need of creating any type of account (for now, it can change in future).

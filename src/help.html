           <!--HOW--TO--START-->
           <h2 id="howto">How to start:</h2>
           <span>As you can read in <a href="https://github.com/mjamry/youtubeScrobbler#scrobbline-" target="_blank">README</a> file, for now it supports only music from youtube.</span>
           <h3>Here are few steps that you should do to fully enjoy your music using this app:</h3>
           <ul>
               <li>Go to the <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">youtube</a>, and search for music you would like to listen to</li>
               <li>open the selected clip or playlist and copy the link from the address bar</li>
               <li>
                   now you can go to the <a href="http://www.scrobbline.com" target="_blank">scrobbline</a> and paste your link to input box which you will find at the center of the screen (see screenshot below)<br>
                   <br><img src="tutorial/howto.png"/>
               </li>
               <li>now wait for a few seconds to load all data from the youtube and the last.fm</li>
               <li>to start playing the music just click on a chosen track on the playlist</li>
           </ul>

           <h4>Few additional information:</h4>
           <ul>
               <li>music loaded from youtube has to have specific naming format/pattern - it should be an artist name and a title separated by dash</li>
               <li>scrobbline will load to its playlist only clips that are matching mentioned pattern</li>
               <li>after loading clip details from youtube, scrobbline will automatically correct the artist name and the title using last.fm database</li>
           </ul>

       <!--PLAYBACK---CONTROLS-->
       <div class="help_content">
           <h2 id="playback_controls">How to control music playback:</h2>
           As you can see on the screen below there are few buttons that allow you to control the music playback.
           It is (from the left):
           <ul>
               <li>play a previous track (if currently played is first one on the playlist, it will load last track - the loop option must be selected otherwise there will be no reaction)</li>
               <li>Play/Pause the music</li>
               <li>play a next track (if currently played track is the last one on the playlist it will jump to first item - the loop option must be selected otherwise there will be no reaction</li>
           </ul>
           It is also possible to rewind currently playing track - by clicking on a progress bar with track title (on the right side of playback controls).

       <!--OTHER--CONTROLS-->
       <div class="help_content">
           <h2 id="other_controls">How to control playlist:</h2>
           There are buttons that allow to control the playlist and its behaviour (starting from the left):
           <ul>
               <li>like/love - it gives a possibility to love a track on the last.fm portal - it is required to be signed into last.fm</li>
               <li>loop - when is selected the playlist will be constantly repeated</li>
               <li>shuffle - when pressed tracks in the playlist will change order (randomly)</li>
               <li>save - allows to store the current playlist - using local storage</li>
               <li>clear - removes all tracks from the playlist (it does not clear saved playlist)</li>

       <!--VOLUME-->
       <div class="help_content">
           <h2 id="volume">How to change volume:</h2>
           It is as easy as controlling track playback - a volume level will be changed when a volume bar will be clicked (left side is 100% right is 0% volume level).

       <div class="help_content">
           <!--EDITOR-->
           <h2 id="editor">How to edit track details:</h2>
           First step is to move the mouse pointer over the a track you want to modify details on the playlist - you will see two icons (trash and pencil) first one will remove the item from the playlist, second one will open a track details editor.
           There are four buttons (see screen below):
           <ul>
               <li>reload - it will get data from the last.fm database to validate its correction</li>
               <li>swap - it will swap the title and the artist name - it is not so rare, that these values are in incorrect order on youtube's track details</li>
               <li>save - stores entered values and refreshes the playlist view</li>
               <li>close - will close the editor without saving changes</li>
           </ul>
           Beside each text input is a small icon which indicating if entered details are correctly recognised by last.fm. It is basing on mbid od received data.

       <!--SIGN--INTO--LAST-FM-->
       <div class="help_content">
           <h2 id="sign_in_last_fm">How to sign into last.fm portal:</h2>
           Without signing into the last.fm portal you will not be able to scrobble music. Another benefit is that you will be able to love the music and see what you've already loved on the playlist view.
           To sign in you have to press a button located on the page header. You will be moved to the last.fm page where you should confirm that you are happy to allow scrobbline.com to scrobble on your profile.
           Do not worry it will not do anything else especially without your will. It will never ask for your password, it is not needed.
